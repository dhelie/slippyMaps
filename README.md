# Slippy Maps and Spatial Data

This workshop will introduce spatial data and some of the popular formats it is represented with mainly GeoJSON and TopoJSON.
We will be learning how to use, generate, store and share spatial data as we proceed with the course leveraging two of the most popular interactive map platforms; leaflet.js and Google Maps. Taking the workshop to the next level, we will experiment with leaflet map layers, custom tile sources and geotiffs. We will learn to georeference imagery mainly historic scanned maps, generate the map tiles, host the tiles and configure and display our slippy map with leaflet. For this exercise we will utilize leafletâ€™s layer switching control to compare satellite tile sources against our custom historic image tile sources.
Tools used (not final): Leaflet.js; Google Maps; geojson.io; TileMill; QGIS;GDAL;
